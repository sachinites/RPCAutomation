# RPCAutomation
Method of generating automatic code for remote procedure call

Abstract

This project aims at automating the task of implementing the RPCs in C. Developer need to specify the RPC specification (signature of RPC) in XML file. The python script parse the xml file and create the new set of files in C which implemets all the functionality required to implement the RPC mechanism between client and server. The task is completely automated and hassle free. Python script generates the client stub/ server stub files, in addition to serialize and deserialize routines. The process of serialization and de-serialization is completely opaque to the developer and developer need not implement any data encoding/decoding routines. Such routines are automatically generated by the python script. Warning : Do not have backpointers in your structures for carrying out RPCs on them.
