Adding a New RPC Maually :
============================
1. Describe the structure layout in c_struct.xml

2. execute c_struct.py

3. in file rpc_spec.h, add the procedure id to the enum, and #include your structure(s) header files generated in step 2
	3.1 procedure id enum should be of format : rpc_[procedure_name]_id

4. Add the RPC signatire also in rpc_spec.h.

5. In rpc_client_stubs.c, write the implementation of a RPC fn for client side.
	5.1 $include structure.h and structure_xdr_serialize.h files also in rpc_client_stubs.c file

6. In file rpc_server_stubs.h, make an entry of stub of your RPC fn. The stub has the fixed format : 
		ser_buff_t * <stub name> (ser_buff_t *)

7. in file rpc_server_stubs.c, #include structure.h and structure_xdr_serialize.h files 
	7.1 in the same file, write the implementation of stub fn

8. In rpc_server_init.c, add an entry of callback stub fn in rpc_callback_array  

9. In file rpc_server_implementation.c, write the implementation of your actual RPC call. NO need to #include any structure/xdr header files. You can include external/standard header files

10. Add #includes <structure.h> files in test.c and call the RPC

11. rpc_server_usercode1.c/.h & rpc_server_common_usr.h are supporting files to enable the user to implement the server side RPC implementation. User can implemenent his user defined business logic in these files which are internal fnd of RPC call. You can define more such header files/.c files as per your will.

12. Edit the make file to include new C files
